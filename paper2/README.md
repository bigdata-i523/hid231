# Abstract

We have come a long way from the stone age to build large scale industries, big cities, bullet trains, and a booming automobile industry. Technological and industrial advances are making our cities smarter by the day and yet a nagging side-effect is air pollution. Air pollution is not only creating local health hazards like respiratory and heart problems, but also directly leading to an increase in temperatures and contributing to global warming. We show how the advances in Big Data, Cloud Computing, and Internet Of Devices can be used to combat air pollution.
