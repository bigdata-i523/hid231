        Open Food Facts is a non-prot initiative started by Stephane Gigandet
and run by thousands of volunteers around the world. Any
person around the world can contribute to the database by simply
scanning a product using a mobile app which is made available to
IOS and Android. is massive database of food products opens up
a lot of opportunities to analyze the food products around the world
and understand their food habits. We are particularly interested in
the consumption of nutrients that come along with the food items
across the world, the composition of dierent fat content, and the
prediction of nutrition grade based on the nutrients.
