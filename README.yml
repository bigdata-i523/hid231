    Food is one of the basic necessities of human-being. It helps us gain energy to recharge our body to do the daily activities like moving, playing, and thinking. From being a cave man to producing wide variety of foods, we have come a long way. The civilizations shaped the food habits of the world and there is a lot of variance in the food habits across countries. We analyze the {\em Open Food Facts} database that gathers information on food products from around the world to unearth some food habits of the world and we predict the food grade based on the nutrition facts of the food products.
