# Using Big Data For Fact Checking

## Abstract
Big Data is no more the elephant in the room it once used to be. Since John Mashey coined the term in 1998, it has come a long way. It is often described as the three V's: Volume, Velocity, and Variety of the data. Of late, a new dimension, Veracity has been gaining importance which describes the quality and accuracy of the data. We show how Big Data can be used to spot fake news, bad data used by politicians, advertisers, and scientists.
